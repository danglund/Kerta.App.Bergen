# PRD: Expandable Features (Mer Tab)

## Overview
A flexible framework tab that serves as a launching pad for future Bergen-themed features and experimental functionality.

## User Story
As a Bergen app user, I want to discover and try new Bergen-related features so I can get more value from the app and provide feedback on what works.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Feature List**: Scrollable list of available and upcoming features
- **Feature States**: Different states (Available, Coming Soon, Experimental)
- **Easy Access**: One-tap access to working features
- **Feature Descriptions**: Brief explanation of what each feature does
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Way for users to express interest in upcoming features

### Framework Requirements
- **Modular Design**: Easy to add new features without redesigning tab
- **Feature Flags**: Ability to enable/disable features for testing
- **Version Gating**: Some features may require newer iOS versions
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle missing capabilities (camera, etc.)

### Planned Future Features
- **Skann en meny** (Scan a menu): OCR + TTS for reading Norwegian menus
- **Lag ein spilleliste** (Create a playlist): Spotify integration for Bergen music
- **Finn andre bergensere** (Find other Bergen people): Map-based social feature
- **Date ein bergenser** (Date a Bergen person): Dating feature for Bergen natives
- **Bergen v√¶ret** (Bergen weather): Local weather with Bergen personality
- **Bergen ord** (Bergen words): Learn Bergen dialect words

### UI Requirements
- **Clean List Design**: Easy to scan list of features
- **Status Indicators**: Clear visual indication of feature availability
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches overall app design language
- **Loading States**: Handle features that need setup or permissions
- **Empty States**: Handle when no features are available

### Technical Requirements
- **Feature Registry**: Centralized system for managing available features
- **Lazy Loading**: Don't load feature code until accessed
- **Permission Handling**: Each feature manages its own permissions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure when features don't work
- **Analytics Ready**: Track which features are most popular

## Feature States

### Available
- Feature is fully implemented and tested
- Appears with normal styling and is tappable
- Leads directly to feature functionality

### Experimental
- Feature is implemented but may have bugs
- Appears with "Beta" or "Experimental" badge
- May have disclaimer about potential issues

### Coming Soon
- Feature is planned but not implemented
- Appears grayed out with "Kommer snart" text
- Allows users to express interest or get notifications

### Disabled
- Feature exists but is temporarily disabled
- May appear with explanation of why it's unavailable
- Could be due to server issues, iOS version, etc.

## Success Criteria
- Users discover and try new features
- Feature addition doesn't break existing functionality
- Clear user feedback on which features are valuable
- Easy maintenance and feature management for developers

## Non-Goals
- Not a full feature store or marketplace
- No paid features or premium content
- No complex user account system
- No feature rating or review system

## Dependencies
- SwiftUI for flexible UI layouts
- Individual feature dependencies vary
- Optional: Analytics framework for usage tracking

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Too many experimental features confuse users
  - **Mitigation**: Limit experimental features, clear labeling
- **Risk**: Feature quality is inconsistent
  - **Mitigation**: Clear quality gates for promotion to "Available"
- **Risk**: Features become abandoned and broken
  - **Mitigation**: Regular review and cleanup of unused features
