# Location Distance Feature - Implementation Progress

## Status: Pending

## Completed Tasks
- [ ] LocationService implementation
- [ ] KartView UI with MapKit integration
- [ ] Distance calculation using Haversine formula
- [ ] Location permission handling
- [ ] Map annotations for Bergen and user location
- [ ] Norwegian text implementation
- [ ] Error state handling
- [ ] Testing with location simulation

## Current Task
Not started - pending Bergen! button completion

## Implementation Notes
- Will use CoreLocation for GPS access
- MapKit for map display with annotations
- Distance calculated using CLLocation.distance(from:)
- Permission requested on first tab access

## Next Steps
1. Implement LocationService class
2. Create KartView with MapKit integration
3. Add distance calculation logic
4. Implement permission request flow
5. Add error handling for location failures
6. Test with iOS Simulator location simulation

## Technical Decisions
- Using CLLocationManager for location services
- MKMapView for map display
- CLLocation.distance(from:) for accurate distance calculation
- Norwegian UI text throughout
- Request permission on tab access, not app launch

## Known Issues
None yet - feature not started

## Testing Plan
- Test permission request flow
- Verify distance calculation accuracy
- Test error handling (permission denied, no GPS, etc.)
- Simulate different locations in iOS Simulator
- Test map display and annotations
- Verify Norwegian text displays correctly
